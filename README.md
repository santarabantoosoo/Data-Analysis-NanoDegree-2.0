# Data-Analysis-NanoDegree-2.0

In Udacity connect sessions for advanced data analytics nano degree by FWD, we have three main resources to share.

1- Tasks
2- Resources[links and cheat sheets, etc.]
3- presentations

This repo is mainly for the first two items; tasks and resources

If you want the presentations, please head to this repo santarabantoosoo/Data-Analyst-ND-presentations: presentations for Udacity connect sessions for fwd advanced data analysis Nano degree

The destinction between the repos is mainly because the presentation increase the size of the repo. This may limit the ease of cloning the repo. This may have negative effects as we may need to clone the repo each week, just before the session.

## what did ADVANCED_DATA_ANALYSIS 1.0 had?   

Same practical statistics content, in addition to pandas and visualization in python(seaborn and matplotlib). These items were replaced by SQL, Tableau and Agile in 2.0
