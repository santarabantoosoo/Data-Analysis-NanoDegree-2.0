    "# Mininally Sufficient Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a summary of all the guidelines in this tutorial along with a list of attributes and methods that provide nearly all of the functionality of Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimally sufficient Pandas\n",
    "* is simple, explicit, straightforward, and boring\n",
    "* has one obvious way to accomplish a task\n",
    "* uses this obvious way every single time\n",
    "* is easier to retain in memory\n",
    "* is easier to read and debug by yourself an others\n",
    "* uses less of the library by eliminating methods that provide no additional functionality\n",
    "* avoids Pandas bugs because of less code\n",
    "* doesn't rely on being tricky to impress friends\n",
    "* makes it easier to use in production\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selecting Subsets of Data\n",
    "    * Select a single column of data with the brackets\n",
    "    * Do not use dot notation\n",
    "    * Be explicit and use `loc` and `iloc`\n",
    "    * Never use `ix`\n",
    "    * No need to use `at` or `iat`\n",
    "* Handling the `SettingWithCopyWarning`\n",
    "    * Know the three cases when it appears\n",
    "        * Correct assignment with side effects\n",
    "        * No assignment\n",
    "        * Correct assignment without side effects\n",
    "    * To handle the warning, you will be in one of two scenarios\n",
    "        * You want to work with a new independent DataFrame - use the `copy` method\n",
    "        * You want to work with original DataFrame. Assign data with a single indexer, `loc`. Avoid chained indexing.\n",
    "* Method Duplication\n",
    "    * Many methods are aliases or provide no extra functionality. Only use one\n",
    "    * All operators have methods. Only use methods when necessary \n",
    "    * Always use Pandas methods and not builtin Python functions\n",
    "* Say No to `apply`\n",
    "    * `apply` is an automated for loop that passes each column or row to a user-defined function\n",
    "    * Use `apply` as a method of last resort\n",
    "    * Using `apply` with `axis='columns'` is one of the slowest operations in all of Pandas\n",
    "* Standardizing `groupby`\n",
    "    * Know the three components\n",
    "        * Grouping columns\n",
    "        * Aggregating columns\n",
    "        * Aggregating functions\n",
    "    * Use the syntax `df.groupby('grouping columns').agg({'aggregating column': 'aggregating function'})\n",
    "* Handling a MultiIndex\n",
    "    * A MultiIndex is difficult to make selections and further process\n",
    "    * I suggest having a single level index\n",
    "    * Rename the columns and reset the index after a groupby\n",
    "* Say no to `apply` with `groupby`\n",
    "    * Can be extremely slow to use `apply` with `groupby`\n",
    "    * Call all methods independent of the group, outside of the custom function\n",
    "* Similarity between groupby, pivot_table, crosstab\n",
    "* Similarity between melt, pivot, stack, unstack\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimal set of DataFrame attributes and methods\n",
    "Below is a short list of DataFrame attributes and methods that allows you maximum coverage of the library.\n",
